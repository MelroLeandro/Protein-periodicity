#Intrudution:

The protein dynamics is currently addressed from two perspectives. The first,
thermodynamic-centric, line of research is mainly concerned with stability and
uniqueness of the native structure and how it is defined by the protein sequence.
The second, kinetics-centric, line of research is concerned with the mechanisms and
time scales for folding. Both aspects of the protein folding problem have received
much attention over the past 60 years, and attempts to build coarse-grained models
of folding, which can yield general insights without sacrificing predictive power, is
an ongoing collective work [7].

Constructing coarse-grained force fields is a much greater challenge than constructing 
all-atom force fields; the physical foundations of coarse-grained force fields
were discovered only relatively recently [1] [46]. These force fields are divided into
two main categories: knowledge-based and physics-based. Knowledge-based force
fields are derived based on statistics determined from structural databases [4], while
physics-based force fields relate all-atom energy surfaces to effective coarse-grained
energy surfaces [13]. Physics-based force fields can, in turn, be divided into neoclassical 
force fields, in which the functional form is copied from that of all-atom force
fields (e.g., the very widely applied MARTINI force field [38]), and those that are
based on the understanding of a coarse-grained force field as a potential of mean
force in which the degrees of freedom that are not omitted from the model have
been integrated out [1][46].
